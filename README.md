 This repository is a practice repo made to save all my javascript work and showcase the consistent learning. Referring to the instructions from linkedIn course. I aim to create a fundamental understanding of the language. 

# Modern Ways to load JavaScript
 ## The default method:
   This method is to write the following code in the HTML document:
  ```
  <script> // Write the js lines in the html document </script>
  <script src=".\ *filename*"> // This statement links the script file to the html document </script> 
  ```
  The above practice loads JavaScript is that browser stops rendering when JavaScript is encountered. Javacript is then executed before the rendering continues. Often referred to as the       content blocking.
